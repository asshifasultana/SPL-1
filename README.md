Hybrid Algorithm Based Image Steganography:

Steganography is the technique of hiding secret information within digital media such as image, audio or video so that its existence remains concealed. It can be used for secure data transmission, digital watermarking and covert communication without drawing attention.

The goal of this project is to develop a secure image steganography system for hiding text data within digital images. This project integrates multiple algorithms to enhance confidentiality, accuracy and resistance to data tampering. 

The objective of this project is to securely hide and accurately retrieve data within images using different approaches combining compression, error handling, chaotic mapping and least significant bit (LSB) embedding.
Algorithms to be Used:
1.	Huffman Coding: It is a lossless compression technique that reduces the size of the message before embedding. 

2.	Hamming Coding: An error detection and correction algorithm that adds parity bits to the message. It can detect and correct single bit errors during extraction, ensuring message integrity.

3.	Chaos Mapping: It generates a random sequence using nonlinear function which enhances security by making the data placement unpredictable.

4.	Least Significant Bit embedding: It is a common technique for hiding data within an image by embedding message bits into the least significant bits of image pixels. Changes are imperceptible to the human eye which ensures visually lossless data hiding.
